# Scupper_ROSRobot
 
Scupper is custom built ROS enable turtlebot similar to something like the Turtlebot 3 Burger. It is capable of SLAM. The robot consists of the Romi chassis from Pololu, a Raspberry Pi 3, a Kinect 360, and some custom made laster cut and 3D-printed pieces to hold it all together. 

The code for the Scupper runs both on the Pi and on my laptop. I have uploaded the catkin workspaces from my Pi and from my laptop.
